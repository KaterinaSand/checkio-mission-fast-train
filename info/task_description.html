<p>
You are planning the train schedule and you want to know the minimum time between the stations.
</p>
<p>
Each section of the rail between stations is given in the list.
Each section is a tuple of distance and speed limit (both are integers).
You can change the speed ( +1. -1 and &plusmn; 0 ) at the start and every minute after that.
The train runs by the same amount as the speed value.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starting speed is 0.</li>
    <li>Speed limit is set for each section of the rail.
        You don't exceed it.</li>
    <li>You must reach the target station at speed 1 (because itâ€™s necessary to stop at the station).
</ul>

<p>
You should return the minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
fast_train([(4, 3)]) == 3 # (1, 2, 1)
fast_train([(9, 5)]) == 5 # (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)

<p><strong>Input: </strong>
List of the section of the rail. Each section is a tuple of distance (as an integer) and speed limit (as an integer). 
</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
