<p>
You are planning the service of the train.
You want to know the minimum time between stations.
</p>
<p>
Each section of the rail between stations is given in the list.
Each section is a tuple of distance and speed limit (Both are integers).
You can change speed ( +1. -1 and &plusmn; 0 ) at start and every minute.
The train runs by the same amount as the speed value.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starting speed is 0.</li>
    <li>Speed limit is set for each section of the rail.
        You don't exceed this.</li>
    <li>You must reach the target station at speed 1.(Because it is necessary to stop at the station)
</ul>

<p>
You should return the minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">
fast_train([(4, 3)]) == 3 # (1, 2, 1)
fast_train([(9, 5)]) == 5 # (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)
fast_train([(5, 5), (4, 2)]) == 6 # e.g. (1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)

<p><strong>Input: </strong>
List of the section of the rail. Each section is tuple of distance (as an integer) and speed limit (as an integer). 
</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
